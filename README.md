# Real-Time_Chat_Application
# Abstract

The Real-Time Chat Application project involves the development of a fully functional chat system using Java. This application supports instant messaging between users, end-to-end encryption for secure communication, message broadcasting, and group chats. The project leverages networking and multithreading to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. The user interface is built using JavaFX, providing a user-friendly and responsive design. This project demonstrates the principles of network programming, multithreading, and security in a real-time application.
